Dagon NG
========
This is an experimental branch of [Dagon game engine](https://github.com/gecko0307/dagon). It aims to fix some architectural drawbacks of the original Dagon, reorganize modules structure, and implement a new flexible renderer. It is going to be Dagon 1.0 with final established API.

The branch is not very usable at the moment. Only minimal functionality from original Dagon is ready, including window creation, entities, built-in shapes, text rendering, Nuklear GUI. Stay tuned!
