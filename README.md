Dagon NG
========
This is current development branch of [Dagon game engine](https://github.com/gecko0307/dagon). Goals are:
* Fix some architectural drawbacks of the original Dagon
* Reorganize modules structure, reduce coupling
* Implement a new flexible renderer based on pipelines and stages.

This branch is going to be Dagon 1.0 with final established API. It is not very usable at the moment, only part of the original functionality is ready.
